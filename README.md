## Cryptocurrency Market

This is a project from a tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6oTpMZp84). We build an application where you can see the price, market cap and all the necessary information about your favorite cryptocurrency in a table and chart.
Although the interface looks similar, but there is something different between mine and the one in the video. I used react-query for fetching and managing data and used different version of MUI.

### What I used to build this application:

- [React.js](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the UI.
- [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for the API endpoint.
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) and [axios](https://axios-http.com/) for fetching and managing data from API.
- [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) for the chart.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying the application.
